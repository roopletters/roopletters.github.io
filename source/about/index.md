When Rupert was born I decided I was going to write him an occasional letter, so he (and me) had something to look back on when he was older. I wrote letters by hand at first, before doing them on the computer, but I've decided to do it on a website / blog instead. This way I will be able to embed photo's and videos and will make it much more enjoyable to look back on.
