    <h1 id="Letter-to-baby"><a href="#Letter-to-baby" class="headerlink" title="Letter to baby"></a>Letter to baby</h1><p>This is your Daddy writing this on the day you were born. Yesterday was a bit hectic as weren’t expecting you to be coming this early. We came to the hospital yesterday expecting Mummy to just be having a scan so we could see you and say hello, but the doctor wanted to get you out early. Probably because he knows what a legend you’re going to be! Me and your Mummy are very excited to meet you in real life, and we have your nice room ready at home with lots of books there ready to read to you. Ted is also there waiting to say hello, he told me last night he can’t wait (in between chewing on his bone).</p>
<p>Right at this very moment I’m reading the newspaper and doing a Sudoku puzzle, and Mummy is listening to Gentle Whispering on youtube and your Nana Knight is having a brew and eating cake. The weather outside is lovely and clear, but cold. In a few hours you’re going to be here and we’re going to love you more than anything. We have lots of plans for you as you grow up. Many fun and interesting things to do, and nice places to go. We can’t wait to do them all with you.</p>
<p>Love Daddy x</p>
